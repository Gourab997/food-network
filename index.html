            <h2 id="about"> About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and
                to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like
                to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to
                feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the
                clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle
                of the night. </p>

            <h2> My Recipies</h2>
            <p> If life could only be as simple as following a recipe,<br> we’d all be much happier. However, unlike
                food
                based recipes, <br>life doesn’t provide you with standardized ingredients as each lives their unique
                life.

                <h2> Thai Food</h2>
                <p>
                    Thai food is widely known for being hot and spicy since almost all Thai food is cooked with basic
                    ingredients such as garlic, chillies, limejuice, lemon grass and fresh coriander leaf and fermented
                    fish sauce (nam pia) or shrimp paste (kapi) to make it salty.

                <h2> Indian Food</h2>
                <p>
                    Staple foods of Indian cuisine include pearl millet (bājra), rice, whole-wheat flour (aṭṭa), and a
                    variety of lentils, such as masoor (most often red lentils), tuer (pigeon peas), urad (black gram),
                    and moong (mung beans). Lentils may be used whole, dehusked—for example, dhuli moong or dhuli
                    urad—or split.

                <p>
                    A Chinese meal is consisted of two parts: staple food, normally made of rice, noodles or steamed
                    buns, and ts'ai, vegetable and meat dishes. (This is different from Western meals, which take meat
                    or animal protein as main dish).
